# Bellarmine-Web-App
Code from my Junior Year Web Application course

The Final Project folder has all the files for my final project except the task list. The task list files are in the other folder. I updated the task list when I submitted my final project.


This is the url for my final project: http://times.bcp.org/webs/apps18/akash/Final_Project_files/Introduction.html

This is the url for the task list: http://times.bcp.org/webs/apps18/akash/To_Do/logintodo.html
