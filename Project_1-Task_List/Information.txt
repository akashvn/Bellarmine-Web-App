My first project is a list a to-do list application that can keep track of tasks. 
Data will be stored in a SQL database and the coding will be in PHP, SQL, Javascript with some CSS and HTML.

My files and data will be published when the servers starts to work again.
I'll upload my code and files I have currently.
