    <!-- Works Cited for project. W3 Schools helped me learn CSS and about other coding things relevant to the code. It espicially helped with some of the more graphics heavy programs. I also used https://www.jotform.com/help/118-How-to-Customize-the-Submit-Button-with-CSS to get my submit button formatting. I used other things for the chess game but everything else is mainly my own.
